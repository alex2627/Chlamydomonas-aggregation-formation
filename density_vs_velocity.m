% It uses the results from the processing_raw.m to calculate the local
% densities and velocities using voronoi tessellation.
% 
% The inputs to the program are:
% pathname: a string containing the directory of the processed results
%
% filename: the name of the file of the proccessed results
%
% saut: the number of frames over which to calculate the average v and rho.
% Typically this is 33, which corresponds to 1 second.
%
% n_bins: this is the number of radial bins. The radius is binned such that 
% the area is perserved, meaning that (r*dr) is constant. This is important
% for small radii, which in the case of constant dr would correspond to 
% small areas, thus particles and therefore low statistics. The constant 
% (r*dr) allows for all bins to have high statistics. Typically the value 
% of n_bins is 50.
